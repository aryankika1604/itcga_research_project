# itcga_research_project

Hello everyone, My name is Aryan Kikaganeshwala. I was accepted to the ITCGA Cancer Workshop which ran for a month.
The ITCGA Cancer Research workshop was a wonderful experience where I got the opportunity to explore the applications of Data Science in detecting potential biomarkers of glioblastoma in blood. For the first 2 weeks, we learned how to work with raw RNA seq data. We worked through the pipeline:

    RNA-Seq data -> Quality Assessment -> Trimming -> Alignment (using the indexed Genome) -> Sorting -> Indexing -> Matrix Gene Expression -> Differential Gene Expression

While following this pipeline we ran various bash scripts to perform the cutadapt for trimming, Hisat for alignment and Samtools for indexing. After completing this process we made a matrix of these genes and used R language to do the differential gene expression analysis. For more details on our findings please look at the presentation provided.

It was a great opportunity to connect with different students, professors and people from other organizations and companies who gave insight into the field of Computational Biology. I would also like to thank my teammates Amelia Prescott and Deron Smoot who helped me understand the biological of our project.
